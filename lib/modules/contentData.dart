    '''I was born and brought up in a small and peaceful town called \"Baar\". It is a town with many beautiful sights and very well-mannered people. It may not be one of the well known places out there, but it's worth a visit for anyone. And thanks to it's kind and beautiful neighborhood there, i have brought up good qualities in my life which represents a part of myself and my town.

My passion for technology already began when i was a kid. Even though it was the worst case scenario for my parents, because of the tremendous damage i've caused, through these trials and errors i've built my way up here where i am now''',
    '''As time went on, i began to get more into IT Science. The internet was starting to become a mainstream thing bringing with itself new adventures. Like the adventurous kid i was back then, i went along the ride and grew up with the \"internet cult\". I could say that i received and made alot of contributions on the internet, be it on social media, video portals or online forums.''',
